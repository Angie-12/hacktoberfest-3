# hacktoberfest
Hello! This is a repository for the hacktoberfest event :)
I am recently working on a quotes bot code so it would be really helpful if you can add some feelings and quotes to it!
So that it can be more effective. Thanks a lot!!!
(fork my repositiory, click on this file called quotesbot.py and add in something. Then send me a pull request:)
I can also contribute to your project if i have something to add to improve it ;)
